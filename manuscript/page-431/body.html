<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Thanksgiving-Day.'</p><p>Everyone was surprised to hear that we had already been twelve months
in the countryâ€”indeed, my wife believed I might be mistaken, until I
showed her how I had calculated regularly ever since the 31st of
January, on which day we were wrecked, by marking off in my almanac the
Sundays as they arrived for the remaining eleven months of that year.</p><p>'Since then,' I added, 'I have counted thirty-one days. This is the 1st
of February. We landed on the 2nd; therefore tomorrow is the
anniversary of the day of our escape. As my bookseller has not sent me
an almanac for the present year, we must henceforth reckon for
ourselves.'</p><p>'Oh, that will be good fun for us,' said Ernest. 'We must have a long
stick, like Robinson Crusoe, and cut a notch in it every day, and count
them up every now and then, to see how the weeks and months and years
go by.'</p></div> </div>
