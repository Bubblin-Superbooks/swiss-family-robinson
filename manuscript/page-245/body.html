the water shallow, than out sprang Jack from his tub, and wading
ashore, took the unsuspecting birds by surprise, and with his stick
laid half a dozen, right and left, either stunned or dead at his feet.
The rest escaped into the water, dived, and disappeared.</p><p>As these penguins are disagreeable food, on account of their strong
oily taste, I was sorry Jack had attacked them; but going to examine
them when we landed, some of the fallen arose from their swoon, and
began solemnly to waddle away, upon which we caught them, and tying
their feet together with long grass, laid them on the sand to wait
until we were ready to start.</p><p>The three wheelbarrows then each received a load, the live penguins
seated gravely were trundled along by Jack, and away we went at a great
rate.</p></div> </div>
