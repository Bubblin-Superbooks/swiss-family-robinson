circle; the hunter gallops after them, but describes a much smaller
circle, and can therefore maintain the pace for a longer time, waiting
to make the attack until the bird is fatigued.</p><p>'Among the Bushmen, the hunter sometimes envelops himself in the skin
of an ostrich, his legs doing duty for those of the bird, and his arm
managing the head and neck so as to imitate the movements of the bird
when feeding. The enterprising hunter is thus enabled to get among a
flock of ostriches, and to shoot them with arrows one after another.</p><p>'When aware of an enemy they defend themselves desperately, using
their powerful legs as weapons, always kicking forwards, and
inflicting dreadful injuries on dogs, and even on men if attacked
without due precaution. But let us take up our positions, and keep
perfectly still, for the ostriches are at hand!'</p></div> </div>
