threw them into a large shallow iron vessel placed on the fire. The
green sweet-scented wax was rapidly melted, rising to the surface of
the juice yielded by the berries. This we skimmed off and placed in a
separate pot by the fire, ready for use, repeating the operation
several times, until we had collected sufficient liquid wax for our
purpose. I then took the wicks my wife had prepared, and dipped them
one after the other into the wax, handing them as I did so to Fritz,
who hung them up on a bush to dry.</p></div> </div>
