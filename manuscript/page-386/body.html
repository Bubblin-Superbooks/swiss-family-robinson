through the riven clouds, the rain ceased to fallâ€”spring had come. No
prisoners set at liberty could have felt more joy than we did as we
stepped forth from our winter abode, refreshed our eyes with the
pleasant verdure around us, and our ears with the merry songs of a
thousand happy birds, and drank in the pure balmy air of spring.</p><p>Our plantations were thriving vigorously. The seed we had sown was
shooting through the moist earth. All nature was refreshed.</p></div> </div>
