his keen eyes eagerly towards the sandy shore, where the flocks of
birds were again settling.</p><p>Presently he shouted, 'Aha, now I see what they are after! They have
got a huge monster of a fish there, and a proper feast they are making!

birds were ravenously feeding; and it was extraordinary to watch the
ferocity, the envy, the gluttony, and all manner of evil passions,
exhibited among the guests at this banquet.</p></div> </div>
