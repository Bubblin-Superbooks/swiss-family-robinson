<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">the day was fast
declining, we made speedy arrangements for burning a watch-fire; after
which we partook of a hasty supper, and leaving the dogs, with Coco,
the jackal, to sleep on shore, we returned on board the yacht for the
night, anchoring within gunshot of the land.</p><p>The coast being quite strange to us, I knew not what wild beasts might
frequent it; but, though I did not fear that any would approach us by
swimming, yet I was glad to have with us our lively little ape, Mercury
(the successor of our old favourite, Knips, long since gathered to his
fathers), for he occupied at night a cosy berth on deck, and was
certain to give vociferous notice should anything alarming occur.</p><p>Fritz moored the cajack alongside, and came on board. The night passed
in peace, although for a time we were disturbed by the yelping of
jackals, with whom Coco persisted in keeping up a noisy conversation.</p></div> </div>
