<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">cuttings have been restored. The material
that continues to be omitted is of little imaginable interest to
anyone other than a scholar of nineteenth century literature.</p><p>Paragraphing has been redone in order to facilitate ease of
reading. Some archaic spelling and grammar have been retained,
as they are part of the flavor of the book; they have been changed
where necessary for clarity. The British-style punctuation has
been retained. The lengthy and unnecessary chapter headings have
been omitted. Some parenthetical information is provided, most
often to define words no longer to be found in many English
dictionaries.</p><p>Anne Wingate, Ph.D.
