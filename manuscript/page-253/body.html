monkey, who were selected as the subjects of this interesting
experiment, and they silently watched them gobbling up the bits of cake
I gave them, until Fritz turned to me, saying, 'Suppose the cake is
poisonous, what effect will it have on the creatures? Will they be
stupefied, or will they suffer pain?'</p><p>'That depends upon the nature of the poison. Some cause violent pain,
as colchicum, hellebore, and aconite. Others produce stupefaction and
paralysis, as opium, hemlock, and prussic acid; while others again, as
strychnine, are followed by violent convulsions, or, as belladonna, by
delirium.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">'The effects of course vary according to the quantity taken, and such
remedies should be applied as will best counteract the effect of each
poison: emetics in any case, to remove as much as possible of the
noxious substance, combined with oils and mucilaginous drinks</p></div> </div>
