perched themselves on our tent pole, and the ducks and geese
waddled off cackling and quacking to the marshy margin of the
river. We too were ready for repose, and having loaded our guns,
and offered up our prayers to God, thanking him for his many
mercies to us, we commended ourselves to his protecting care,
and as the last ray of light departed, closed our tent and lay
down to rest.</p><p>The children remarked the suddenness of nightfall, for indeed
there had been little or no twilight. This convinced me that we
must be not far from the equator, for twilight results from the
refraction of the sun's rays; the more obliquely these rays fall,
the further does the partial light extend, while the more
perpendicularly they strike the earth the longer do they continue
their undiminished force, until when the sun sinks, they totally
disappear, thus producing sudden darkness.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
