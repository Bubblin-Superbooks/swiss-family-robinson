was dissipated by their joyous appearance, and reproof always died away

evening did we remark that his cajack was gone, and that he must be out
at sea.</p><p>Anxious to see him return before nightfall, I went off to Shark Island
with Ernest and Jack, in order to look out for him from the watch-tower
there, at the same time hoisting our signal flag, and loading the gun.</p><p>Long we gazed across the expanse of ocean glittering in the level

the distance which, by the telescope, was proved to be the returning
wanderer.</p><p>I remarked that his skiff sailed at a slower rate than usual towards
the shore. The cannon was fired to let him know that his approach was
observed, and then we joyfully hurried back to receive him at the
harbour.</p></div> </div>
