<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>We had planned the destruction of the vessel, we knew that it was for
the best; and yet that night we went to bed with a feeling of sadness
in our hearts, as though we had lost a dear old friend.</p><p>Next morning all our sadness was dispelled, and it was with pleasure
that we saw the shore lined with a rich store of planks and beams, the
remnants of the wreck. I soon found, too, the copper cauldron which was
successfully floated by the casks; this I got on shore, and hauling it
up among the rocks, stored under it the powder casks we had landed the
day before.</p><p>Collecting all these valuables gave us some little trouble, and while
we were thus engaged my wife brought us good news. She had discovered
that two ducks and a goose had each reared a large family among the
reeds by the river; and they presently appeared waddling past us,
apparently vastly well-pleased with their performance. We greeted them
joyfully.</p></div> </div>
