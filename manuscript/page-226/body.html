supper from the ship's provisions, and then rested for the night on
spring mattresses, a perfect luxury to us, after our hard and narrow
hammocks.</p><p>Next morning we actively set about loading the raft and boat: first
carrying off the entire contents of our own cabins; and, passing on to
the captain's room, we removed the furniture, as well as the doors and
window-frames, with their bolts, bars and locks. We next took the
officers' chests, and those belonging to the carpenter and gunsmith;
the contents of these latter we had to remove in portions, as their
weight was far beyond our strength.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">One large chest was filled with an assortment of fancy goods, and
reminded us of a jeweller's shop, so glittering was the display of gold
and silver watches,</p></div> </div>
