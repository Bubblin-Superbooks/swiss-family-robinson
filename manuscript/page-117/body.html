supper for you; with these and your ham I do not think we shall
starve.'</p><p>Leaving my wife to prepare supper, we returned to the shore and
brought up what of the cargo we had left there; then, having collected
our herd of animals (except for the sow, which ran away, and the ducks
and geese which deserted us for a nearby marshy swamp), we returned to
the tent.</p><p>The meal which awaited us was as unlike the first supper we had there
enjoyed as possible. My wife had improvised a table of a board laid on
two casks, on this was spread a white damask tablecloth, on which were
placed knives, forks, spoons and plates for each person. A tureen of
good soup first appeared, followed by a capital omelette, then slices
of the ham; and finally some Dutch cheese, butter and biscuits, with a
bottle of the captain's canary wine, completed the repast.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">While we thus regaled ourselves, I related to my wife</p></div> </div>
