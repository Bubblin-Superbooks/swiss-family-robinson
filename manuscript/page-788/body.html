<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">lads, whilst their mother and
sister found abundant occupation in the poultry-yard and house.</p><p>Our various settlements and stations required attention. Falconhurst,
Woodlands, Prospect Hill, Shark and Whale Islands were in turn visited
and set in order. The duty of attending to the island battery fell to
Jack and Franz.</p><p>They had been busy all day repairing the flagstaff, rehoisting the
flag, and cleaning and putting into working order the two guns. Evening
was drawing on and our day's work over; the rest of us were strolling
up and down upon the beach enjoying the cool sea breeze. We watched the
lads as they completed their work. They loaded and ran out their guns
and, paddling off with an empty tub in the cajack, placed it out to sea
as a mark for practice. They returned and fired, and the barrel flew in
pieces; with a shout of triumph, they cleaned the guns and ran them in.</p></div> </div>
