the horizon, and passing storms of wind, with thunder, lightning, and
torrents of rain swept over the face of nature from time to time.</p><p>The sea was in frequent commotion; heavy groundswells drove masses of
water hissing and foaming against the cliffs.</p><p>Everything heralded the approaching rains. All nature joined in
sounding forth the solemn overture to the grandest work of the year.</p><p>It was now near the beginning of the month of June, and we had twelve
weeks of bad weather before us.</p><p>We established some of the animals with ourselves at the salt-cave. The
cow, the ass, Lightfoot, Storm and the dogs, were all necessary to us,
while Knips, Fangs and the eagle were sure to be a great amusement in
the long evenings.</p></div> </div>
