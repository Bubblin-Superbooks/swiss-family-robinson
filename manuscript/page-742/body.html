battered bones in the yacht here. You are awfully considerate though,
old fellow,' remarked Jack, not for a moment doubting that his brother
expected him to return, as he came, beside him in the cajack.</p><p>Fritz laughed, and commended his decision. Then, springing into his
skiff, he led the way towards the open sea.</p><p>We followed carefully and soon passed the reef; after which the boys
were very busy with the sails, putting the vessel on the homeward
course, when, waving his hand to me, Fritz turned in the opposite
direction, and quickly vanished behind the point, which I afterwards
named Cape Farewell.</p><p>When missed by his brothers, I said he had a fancy to explore more of
the coast, and if he found it interesting, he might, instead of only a
few hours, remain absent for two or three days.</p></div> </div>
