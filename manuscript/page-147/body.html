<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>There fortunately were one or two trees close to the stream on either
side; I attached a rope pretty near one end of a beam, and slung it
loosely to the tree beside us; then, fastening a long rope to the other
end, I crossed with it by means of broken rocks and stones, and having
a pulley and block, I soon arranged the rope on a strong limb of the
opposite tree, again returning with the end to our own side.</p><p>Now putting my idea to the proof, I brought the ass and the cow, and
fastening this rope to the harness I had previously contrived for them,
I drove them steadily away from the bank. To my great satisfaction, and
the surprise and delight of the boys, the end of the plank which had
been laid alongside the stream began gently to move, rose higher,
turned, and soon projecting over the water continued to advance, until,
having described the segment of a circle, it reached the opposite bank.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I stopped my team, the plank rested on the ground,</p></div> </div>
