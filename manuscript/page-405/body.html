on the sand. We at length, when we had captured as many fish as we
could possibly utilize, set about cleaning and preparing their flesh.
Some we salted, some we dried like the herrings, some we treated like
the tunny of the Mediterraneanâ€”we prepared them in oil.</p><p>Of the roe of the sturgeon I decided to form caviare, the great
Russian dish. I removed from it all the membranes by which it is
surrounded, washed it in vinegar, salted it, pressed out all the
moisture caused by the water-absorbing properties of the salt, packed
it in small barrels and stowed it away in our storehouse.</p><p>I knew that of the sturgeon's bladder the best isinglass is made, so
carefully collecting the air-bladders from all those we had killed, I
washed them and hung them up to stiffen. The outer coat or membrane I
then peeled off, cutting the remainder into strips, technically called
staples.</p></div> </div>
