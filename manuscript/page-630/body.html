<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>'Why, father, should we not make a canoe, something swifter and more
manageable than those vessels we as yet possess? I often long for a
light skiff, in which I might skim over the surface of the water.' The
idea delighted all hands, but my wife, who was never happy when we were
on the sea, declared that our chances of drowning were, with the
pinnace and canoe, already sufficiently great, and that there was not
the slightest necessity for our adding to these chances by constructing
another craft which would tempt us out upon the perfidious element.</p><p>Her fears were, however, speedily allayed, for I assured her that the
boat I intended to construct should be no flimsy cockleshell, but as
safe and stout a craft as ever floated upon the sea. The Greenlander's
cajack I intended to be my model, and I resolved not only to occupy the
children, but also to produce a strong and serviceable canoeâ€”a
masterpiece of art.</p></div> </div>
