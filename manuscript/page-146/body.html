line!'</p><p>Adopting my son's idea, we speedily ascertained the distance across to
be eighteen feet. Then allowing three feet more at each side, I
calculated twenty-four feet as the necessary length of the boards.</p><p>The question as to how the planks were to be laid across was a
difficult one. We resolved to discuss it during dinner, to which we
were now summoned. And my wife, as we sat resting, displayed to me her
needlework. With hard labour had she made two large canvas bags for the
ass to carry. Having no suitable needle, she had been obliged to bore
the hole for each stitch with a nail, and gained great praise for her
ingenuity and patience.</p><p>Dinner was quickly dispatched, as we were all eager to continue our
engineering work. A scheme had occurred to me for conveying one end of
a plank across the water, and I set about it in this way.</p></div> </div>
