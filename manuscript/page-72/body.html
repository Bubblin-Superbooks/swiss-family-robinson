<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">way through, I feared at every step that
we might tread on some venomous snake.</p><p>Sending Turk in advance, I cut one of the reeds, thinking it would
be a more useful weapon against a reptile than my gun. I had
carried it but a little way, when I noticed a thick juice exuding
from one end. I tasted it, and to my delight, found it sweet and
pleasant. I at once knew that I was standing amongst sugar-canes.</p><p>Wishing Fritz to make the same discovery, I advised him to cut a
cane for his defense; he did so, and as he beat the ground before
him, the reed split, and his hand was covered with the juice. He
carefully touched the cane with the tip of his tongue, then,
finding the juice sweet, he did so again with less hesitation;
and a moment afterwards sprang back to me, exclaiming, 'Oh, father,
sugar-cane, sugar-cane! Taste it. Oh, how delicious, how
delightful! Do let us take a lot home to mother,' he continued,
sucking eagerly at the cane!</p></div> </div>
