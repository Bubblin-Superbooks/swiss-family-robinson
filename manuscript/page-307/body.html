numbers are kept down; birds, other insects, and even four-footed
beasts prey upon them.</p><p>'Chief among the latter is the ant-eater, or tamanoir, of South
America, a large creature six or seven feet in length, covered with
long coarse hair, drooping like a heavy plume over the hind quarters.
The head is wonderfully elongated and very narrow; it is destitute of
teeth, and the tongue resembles somewhat a large great red earth-worm.
It has immensely strong curved claws, with which it tears and breaks
down and scratches to pieces the hard walls of the ant-heaps; then,
protruding its sticky tongue, it coils and twists it about among the
terrified millions disturbed by its attack; they adhere to this
horrible invader, and are drawn irresistibly backward into the hungry,
toothless jaws awaiting them.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">'The little ant-eater is not more than about</p></div> </div>
