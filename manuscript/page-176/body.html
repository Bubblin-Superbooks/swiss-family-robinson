porcupine, a delicious bowl of soup made from a piece of the same
animal, cheese, butter, and biscuits, forming a most tempting repast.
Having done this ample justice, we collected our cattle, and the
pigeons and fowls having retired to roost on the neighbouring trees,
and on the steps of our ladder, we made up a glorious fire to keep off
any prowling wild beasts, and ourselves lay down.</p><p>The children, in spite of the novelty of the hammocks, were quickly
asleep. In vain I tried to follow their example; a thousand anxious
thoughts presented themselves, and as quickly as I dispelled them
others rose in their place. The night wore on, and I was still awake;
the fire burned low, and I rose and replenished it with dry fuel. Then
again I climbed into my hammock, and towards morning fell asleep.</p></div> </div>
