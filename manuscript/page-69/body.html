too,' said Fritz, examining the gourd. 'But supposing you had
wanted to make a bottle, how would you have set to work?'</p><p>'It would be an easier operation than this, if possible. All that
is necessary, is to cut a round hole at one end, then to scoop
out the interior, and to drop in several shot or stones; when
these are shaken, any remaining portions of the fruit are detached,
and the gourd is thoroughly cleaned, and the bottle completed.'</p><p>'That would not make a very convenient bottle though, father; it
would be more like a barrel.'</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">'True, my boy; if you want a more shapely vessel, you must take
it in hand when it is younger. To give it a neck, for instance,
you must tie a bandage round the young gourd while it is still
on the tree, and then all will swell but that part which you have
checked.' As I spoke, I filled the gourds with sand, and left
them to dry;</p></div> </div>
