towards Rockburg. He was carrying, in a basket, an immense eel, which
he and Ernest had secured.</p><p>Ernest had set, on the previous night, a couple of lines; one had been
dragged away, but on the other they found this splendid fellow.</p><p>It proved delicious. Half was prepared for dinner, and the other half
salted and stowed away.</p><p>We now, for a short time, again turned our attention to our duties
about the house.</p><p>Thinking that the verandah would be greatly improved by some creepers,
I sowed round the foot of each bamboo pillar, vanilla, and pepper-seed,
as well as that of other creeping plants, which would not only give the
house a pleasanter aspect, but also afford us shade during the summer
months.</p></div> </div>
