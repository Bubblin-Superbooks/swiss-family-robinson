of blazing hay thrown into this hole may, if the place be small,

low. If there is sufficient oxygen to maintain a flame, the
action of the flame increases air circulation, which then
brings in more oxygen. The flame goes out if the oxygen
supply is insufficient for its supply; in this case, it
takes the fireworks to create adequate circulation. The next
torch is able to blaze not because the air is purified, but
because the oxygen is now sufficient to feed the fire.</li></ul><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I saw that we must apply some more efficacious remedy, and sent the
