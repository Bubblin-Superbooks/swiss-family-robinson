birds and insects to do their work in purging the atmosphere, and
reducing the whale to a skeleton before we revisited the island.</p><p>The idea of a rowing-machine kept recurring to my brain, and I
determined to attempt to make one. I took an iron bar, which when laid
across the middle of the boat projected about a foot each way. I
provided this bar in the middle with ribbed machinery, and at each end
with a sort of nave, in which, as in a cart wheel, four flat spokes, or
paddles, were fixed obliquely. These were intended to do the rowers'
part.</p><p>Then the jack was arranged to act upon the machinery in the middle of
the iron cross-bar, in such a way that one of its strong cogwheels bit
firmly into the ribs, so that when it was wound up, it caused the bar
to revolve rapidly, of course turning with it the paddles fixed at
either end, which consequently struck the water so as to propel the
boat.</p></div> </div>
