bring me one of our gourd bottles.'</p><p>I took the gourd, one of those I had previously prepared, with a small
hole at one end and well hollowed-out and cleaned; this I partially
filled with cream and then corked up the hole tightly.</p><p>'Here, boys,' said I, 'you can continue the operation while I turn
carpenter and make a cart to take the place of our sledge.' I gave them
their directions, and then set about my own work.</p><p>They fixed four posts in the ground, and to them fastened a square
piece of sailcloth by four cords attached to the corners. In this
cradle they placed the gourd of cream, and each taking a side, rolled
it backwards and forwards continuously for half an hour.</p><p>'Now,' I cried, looking up from my work, 'open the gourd and take the
contents to your mother, with my compliments.'</p></div> </div>
