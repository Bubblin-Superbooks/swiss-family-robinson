expressed it; then, as though suddenly startled, the whole party took
wing, with the shrill whizzing sound peculiar to the flight of pigeons,
and circling above us, they rose higher, higher, finally darting quite
out of sight.</p><p>While we were yet gazing after them, they reappeared, and settled

which showed they accepted this as a home, up sprang the three blue
pigeons, the noble foreigners, for whom chiefly I had planned the
house, and rising in circles high in air, winged their rapid way direct
towards Falconhurst.</p><p>Their departure had such air of determination and resolve about it,
that I feared them lost to us for ever.</p><p>Endeavouring to console ourselves by petting our four remaining birds,

remained the centre of attraction.</p></div> </div>
