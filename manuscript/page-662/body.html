<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">eastern coast of Africa is found a smaller species of walrus
called the dugong: it has long incisor teeth, but not tusks; and
certainly resembles a seal rather than a walrus.'</p><p>While thus speaking, we were actively engaged in the decapitation of
the walrus, and in cutting off long strips of its skin. This took some
time, as we had not the proper implements, and Fritz remarked, that in
future the cajack must be provided with a hunting-knife and a hatchet;
adding that he should like to have a small compass, in a box with a
glass top, fixed in front of the hole where the steersman sits. I saw
the necessity of this and I promised it should be done.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Our work being accomplished, we were ready to go, and I proposed to
take Fritz and the canoe on board our boat, so that we might all arrive
together; but I yielded to his earnest wish to return alone as he came;
he longed to act as our avant-courier, and announce our approach</p></div> </div>
