by sea in his cajack round Cape Disappointment and so meet us at
Rockburg.</p><p>He was much interested in examining the outlines of the coast, and the
rugged precipices of the Cape. These were tenanted by vast flocks of
sea-fowl and birds of prey; while many varieties of shrubs and plants,
hitherto unknown to us, grew in the clefts and crevices of the rocks,
some of them diffusing a strong aromatic odour. Among the specimens he
brought I recognized the caper plant and, with still greater pleasure,
a shrub which was, I felt sure, the tea-plant of Chinaâ€”it bore very
pretty white flowers and the leaves resembled myrtle.</p><p>Our land journey was effected without accident or adventure of any
kind.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Jack, mounted as usual on Hurry, the ostrich,</p></div> </div>
