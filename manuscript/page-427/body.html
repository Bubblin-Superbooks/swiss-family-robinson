<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">after this little
fellow?'</p><p>'Oh yes, father!' he replied. 'Once you told me about a strong man, I
think his name was Milo, and he had a tiny calf, and he used to carry
it about everywhere. It grew bigger and bigger, but still he carried it
often, till at last he grew so strong that when it was quite a great
big ox, he could lift it as easily as ever. And so you see, if I take
care of our wee calf and teach it to do what I like, perhaps when it
grows big I shall still be able to manage it, and then—oh, papa—do
you think I might ride upon it?'</p><p>I smiled at the child's simplicity, and his funny application of the
story of Milo of Crotona.</p><p>'The calf shall be yours, my boy. Make him as tame as you can, and we
will see about letting you mount him some day; but remember he will be
a great bull long before you are nearly a man. Now what will you call
him?'</p></div> </div>
