<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>After threshing, we proceeded to winnowing: by simply throwing the
threshed corn with shovels high in the air when the land or sea-breeze
blew strong, the chaff and refuse was carried away by the wind and the
grain fell to the ground.</p><p>During these operations our poultry paid the threshing-floor many
visits, testifying a lively interest in the success of our labours, and
gobbling up the grain at such a rate that my wife was obliged to keep
them at a reasonable distance; but I would not have them altogether
stinted in the midst of our plenty. I said, 'Let them enjoy themselves;
what we lose in grain, we gain in flesh. I anticipate delicious
chicken-pie, roast goose, and boiled turkey!'</p><p>When our harvest stores were housed, we found that we had reaped
sixty, eighty, even a hundred-fold what had been sown. Our garner was
truly filled with all manner of store.</p></div> </div>
