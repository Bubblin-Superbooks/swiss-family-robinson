larger than a wren, and the walls were covered by thousands of their
nests. They were rudely built, and their peculiarity was that each
rested on a kind of platform, something like a spoon without the
handle. I detached a number, and found that they had a curious

more like a set of sponges, corals, or fungi, than nests of birds. I
have brought them home in my fishing net.'</p><p>'If we had commercial dealings with the Chinese,' said I, 'your
discovery would be of value; these are doubtless edible birds' nests.
The bird is called the esculent swallow, and the trade in this strange
article of diet is a very large one. The nests are of different value,
but those which are quite new, and nearly white, are held in such
esteem that they are worth their weight in silver.</p></div> </div>
