agricultural operations. This year we pickled only two barrels of them;
but we were not so merciful towards the seals, which arrived on the
coast directly afterwards. We hunted them vigorously, requiring their
skins for many purposes, more especially for the completion of the
cajack. On the little deck of that tiny vessel I had made a kind of
magazine, in which to store pistols, ammunition, water and provisions,
and this I meant to cover with seal-skin, so as to be quite watertight.
A couple of harpoons furnished with seal bladders were to be suspended
alongside.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
