<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>The boys would ride over to Falconhurst very often to see that all was
in order there, and fetch anything required.</p><p>Much remained to be done in order to give the cave a comfortable
appearance, which became more desirable now that we had to live
indoors.</p><p>The darkness of the inner regions annoyed me, and I set myself to
invent a remedy. After some thought, I called in Jack's assistance, and
we got a very tall, strong bamboo, which would reach right up to the
vaulted roof. This we planted in the earthen floor, securing it well by
driving wedges in round it.</p><p>Jack ascended this pole very cleverly, taking with him a hammer and
chisel to enlarge a crevice in the roof so as to fix a pulley, by means
of which, when he descended, I drew up a large ship's lantern, well
supplied with oil, and as there were four wicks, it afforded a very
fair amount of light.</p></div> </div>
