singular-looking creature I ever beheld. It was taking wonderful flying
leaps, apparently in a sitting posture, and got over the ground at an
astonishing rate. I attempted to shoot it as it passed, but missed.</p><p>Ernest, who was behind me, observed its movements very coolly, and
seeing that the dog was puzzled, and that the animal, having paused,
was crouching among the grass, went cautiously nearer, fired at the
spot he had marked, and shot it dead.</p><p>The extraordinary appearance of this creature surprised us very much.
It was as large as a sheep, its head was shaped like that of a mouse;
its skin also was of a mouse-colour; it had long ears like a hare, and
a tail like a tiger's. The fore-paws resembled those of a squirrel, but
they seemed only half-grown while the hind legs were enormous, and so
long, that when upright on them the animal would look as if mounted on
stilts.</p></div> </div>
