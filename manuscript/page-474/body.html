do, was to help me to make a row; I wonder you did not hear us! The
very rocks rang, but nothing came of it, so despair drove me to think
of an expedient. I cut down all the reeds I could reach round and round
me, and bound them together into this bundle, which made a firm place
on which to lean, while I worked and kicked about to free my feet and
legs, and after much struggling, I managed to get astride on the reeds.</p><p>'There I sat, supported above the mud and slime, while Fangs ran
yelping backwards and forwards between me and the bank, seeming
surprised I did not follow. Suddenly I thought of catching hold of his
tail. He dragged and pulled, and I sprawled, and crawled, and waded,
sometimes on my reeds like a raft, sometimes lugging them along with
me, till we luckily got back to terra firma. But I had a near squeak
for it, I can tell you.'</p></div> </div>
