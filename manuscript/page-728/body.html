Fritz and I were still employed in taking on board the last load of our
tools, when we suddenly heard a shot, a loud cry of pain or fear, and
then another shot.</p><p>At the first alarm, the other two dogs rushed away from us towards the
spot, and Fritz, who had just called Pounce from his perch, to
accompany us in the ramble, let him fly, and seizing his rifle darted
off in the same direction.</p><p>Before I could reach the scene of action, more shots were heard, and
then a shout of victory; after which appeared through the stems of the
trees the disconsolate figure of Jack, hobbling along like a cripple,
supported on each side by his brothers.</p><p>When they came near me they stopped; and poor Jack, moaning and
groaning, began to feel himself all over, as if to search for broken
bones, crying out:</p><p>'I'm pounded like a half-crushed pepper-corn!'</p></div> </div>
