acquaintance, the whale? What else could it be?'</p><p>'Oh no, father, it is not the whale. This thing has not fish bones, but
real good, honest, huge, beast bones. I don't know what can have become
of the whaleâ€”floated out to sea most likely. This mammoth is ever so
much bigger. Come and see!'</p><p>As I was about to follow the boy, a voice from another direction
suddenly cried:</p><p>'Father! Father! A great enormous turtle! Please make haste. It is
waddling back to the sea as hard as it can go, and we can't stop it.'</p><p>This appeal being more pressing, as well as more important, than
Jack's, I snatched up an oar and hastened to their assistance.</p><p>Sure enough a large turtle was scrambling quickly towards the water,
and was within a few paces of it, although Ernest was valiantly holding
on by one of its hind legs.</p></div> </div>
