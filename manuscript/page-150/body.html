even for a night, nor exist an hour without her magic bag, I agreed to
do my best to please her, without downright cruelty to animals.</p><p>Away ran the children to catch the cocks and hens. Great chasing,
fluttering and cackling ensued; but with no success whatever, until my
wife recalled her panting sons, and, scattering some handfuls of grain

enclosure; where, when the curtain was dropped, they were easily
caught, tied together, and placed on the cow.</p><p>This amiable and phlegmatic animal had stood calmly chewing the cud,
while package after package was disposed on her broad back, nor did she
now object even to this noisy addition to her load. I placed a couple
of half-hoops over all; and, spreading sailcloth on them, put the fowls
in darkness, and they rapidly became quiet; and the cow, with the
appearance of having a small waggon on her back, was ready to start.</p></div> </div>
