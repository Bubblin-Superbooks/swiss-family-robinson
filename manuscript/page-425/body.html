the race of Hottentots who inhabit the south of Africa, among all sorts
of wild and ferocious animals.</p><p>'The wealth of these people consists solely in their flocks and herds,
and for their protection, they train their bulls to act as guards.</p><p>'These courageous animals keep the rest from straying away, and when
danger threatens, they give instant notice of it, drive the herd
together in a mass, the calves and young cows being placed in the
centre; around them the bulls and strong oxen make a formidable circle
with their horned heads turned to the front, offering determined
resistance to the fiercest foe.</p><p>'These fighting bulls will even sometimes rush with dreadful bellowing
to meet the enemy; and should it be a mighty lion or other strong and
daring monster, sacrifice their own lives in defence of the herd.</p></div> </div>
