determined to conceal with bark, as less likely to attract the notice
of wild beasts or savages should they approach during our absence.</p><p>The cave itself we divided into four parts: in front, a large
compartment into which the door opened, subdivided into our sitting,
eating and sleeping apartments; the right-hand division, containing our
kitchen and workshop, and the left our stables; behind all this, in the
dark recess of the cave, was our storehouse and powder-magazine.</p><p>Having already undergone one rainy reason, we knew well its
discomforts, and thought of many useful arrangements in the laying-out
of our dwelling. We did not intend to be again smoke-dried; we,
therefore, contrived a properly built fireplace and chimney; our stable
arrangements, too, were better, and plenty of space was left in our
workshop that we should not be hampered in even the most extensive
operations.</p></div> </div>
