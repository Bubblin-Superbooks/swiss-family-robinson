a visit from other shoals of fish. Jack espied them first, and called
to us that a lot of young whales were off the coast. We ran down and
discovered the bay apparently swarming with great sturgeon, salmon, and
trout, all making for the mouth of Jackal River, that they might ascend
it and deposit their spawn amongst the stones.</p><p>Jack was delighted at his discovery. 'Here are proper fish!' he
exclaimed, 'none of your paltry fry. How do you preserve these sorts of
fish? Potted, salted or smoked?'</p><p>'Not so fast,' said I, 'not so fast; tell me how they are to be
