came the sound of three guns booming across the water from the
westward.</p><p>We stopped, speechless. Was it fancy? Had we really heard guns from a
strange ship? Or had the boys again fired? No! There were the lads
leaping into their canoe and paddling in hot haste towards us. They,
too, had heard the sound.</p><p>A tumult of feelings rushed over usâ€”anxiety, joy, hope, doubt, each in
turn took possession of our minds. Was it a European vessel close upon
our shores, and were we about to be linked once more to civilized life?
Or did those sounds proceed from a Malay pirate, who would rob and
murder us? What was to be the result of meeting with our fellow beings;
were they to be friends who would help us, enemies who would attack us,
or would they prove unfortunate creatures in need of our assistance?
Who could tell?</p></div> </div>
