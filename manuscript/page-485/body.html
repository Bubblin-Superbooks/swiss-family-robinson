heavy on his hands.</p><p>Books occupied me so much that but little carpentering was done, yet I
made a yoke for the oxen, a pair of cotton-wool carders, and a
spinning-wheel for my wife.</p><p>As the rainy season drew to a close, the weather for a while became
wilder, and the storms fiercer than ever. Thunder roared, lightning
blazed, torrents rushed towards the sea, which came in raging billows
to meet them, lashed to fury by the tempests of wind which swept the
surface of the deep.</p><p>The uproar of the elements came to an end at last. Nature resumed her
attitude of repose, her smiling aspect of peaceful beauty; and soon all
traces of the ravages of floods and storms would disappear beneath the
luxuriant vegetation of the tropics.</p></div> </div>
