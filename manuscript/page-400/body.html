throwing them to us on the shore. As quickly as possible we cleaned
them, and placed them in casks with salt, first a layer of salt, and
then a layer of herrings, and so on, until we had ready many casks of
pickled fish.</p><p>As the barrels were filled, we closed them carefully, and rolled them
away to the cool vaults at the back of our cave. Our good fortune,
however, was not to end here. A day after the herring fishery was over,
and the shoal had left our bay, a great number of seals appeared,
attracted by the refuse of the herrings which we had thrown into the
sea.</p><p>Though I feared they would not be suitable for our table, we yet
secured a score or two for the sake of their skins and fat. The skins
we drew carefully off for harness and clothing, and the fat we boiled
down for oil, which we put aside in casks for tanning, soap-making, and
burning in lamps.</p></div> </div>
