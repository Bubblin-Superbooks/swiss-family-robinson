looked very pretty in patterns upon the transparent porcelain.</p><p>Some of my china vessels cracked with the heat of the stove, some were
very ill-shaped; but, after many failures, I succeeded in producing a
set of white cups and saucers, a cream-jug, a sugar-basin, and half a
dozen small plates.</p><p>I must allow that my china was far from perfect; the shape of some of
the vessels was faulty, and none were really transparent;
nevertheless, the general appearance gave great satisfaction, and when
the plates were filled with rosy and golden fruit resting on green
leaves, and fragrant tea filled the cups, it greatly added to the
appearance of the table.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
