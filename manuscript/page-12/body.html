closed over a wild and terrific scene, and returning light as often
brought but renewed distress, for the raging storm increased in
fury until on the seventh day all hope was lost.</p><p>We were driven completely out of our course; no conjecture
could be formed as to our whereabouts. The crew had lost heart,
and were utterly exhausted by incessant labour. The riven masts
had gone by the board, leaks had been sprung in every direction,
and the water, which rushed in, gained upon us rapidly.</p></div> </div>
