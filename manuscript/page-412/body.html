of the bark, some of which, to my great surprise, I found was that of
the terebinth tree, and the rest that of the American fir. The goats,
too, made an important discovery amongst the same heap, for we found
them busily routing out pieces of cinnamon, a most delicious and
aromatic spice.</p><p>'From the fir,' said I to the boys, 'we get turpentine and tar, and
thus it is that the fir tree becomes such a valuable article of
commerce. So we may look forward to preparing pitch for our yacht with
tar and oil, you know, and cart-grease, too, with tar and fat. I do not
know that you will equally appreciate the terebinth tree; a gum issues
from incisions in the bark which hardens in the sun, and becomes as
transparent as amber; when burned it gives forth a most delicious
perfume, and when dissolved in spirits of wine, forms a beautiful
transparent varnish.'</p></div> </div>
