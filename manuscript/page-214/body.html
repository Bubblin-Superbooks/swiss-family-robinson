spared himself all trouble; at the same time I observed that it is
wrong to waste the precious moments in sleep when duty has to be
performed. I then bid him go and collect some salt, which was wanted at
home, while I went to bathe.</p><p>On coming back, much refreshed, I again missed Ernest, and began to
wonder whether he was still gathering salt, or whether he had lain down
somewhere to finish his nap, when I heard him loudly calling: 'Father,
father! I've caught a fish! An immense fellow he is. I can scarcely
hold him, he drags the line so!'</p><p>Hastening towards the spot, I saw the boy lying in the grass, on a
point of land close to the mouth of the stream, and with all his might
keeping hold of a rod. The line was strained to the utmost by the
frantic efforts of a very large fish, which was attempting to free
itself from the hook.</p></div> </div>
