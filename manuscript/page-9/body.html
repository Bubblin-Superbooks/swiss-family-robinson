<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Foreword</h3><p class="  start-chapter">No unabridged edition of <Swiss Family Robinson> exists in English.
Indeed, the book has been rewritten so many times, by so many
editors, that it can legitimately be said that that no complete
edition of the book exists in <em>any</em> language.</p><p>Johann David Wyss, a Swiss pastor, originally wrote this book
to entertain and instruct his four sons. Years later, his son
Johann (or Jeanâ€”accounts differ) Rudolf Wyss, by then a professor
of philosophy, persuaded his father to allow him to complete and
edit the unfinished manuscript. It was published in two volumes
in Zurich in 1812-1813.</p></div> </div>
