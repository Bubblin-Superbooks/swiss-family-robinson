rock we came to, although by pressing further upwards, we might have
attained to a pleasanter spot.</p><p>Looking back towards the Gap, we marked the strange contrast of the
smiling country bordering the river, and the dreary, monotonous plain
we had traversed.</p><p>After gazing on the distant scene, we produced our store of
provisions, and were busily engaged, when Knips (our constant
companion) suddenly began to snuff and smell about in a very
ridiculous way; finally, with a shriek which we knew was expressive of
pleasure, he set off at full speed, followed by all the dogs, up a sort
of glen behind us.</p><p>We left them to their own devices, being far too pleasantly engaged
with our refreshments to care much what fancy the little rogue had got
in his head.</p></div> </div>
