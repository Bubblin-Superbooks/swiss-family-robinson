cattle, and made the birds of the air most welcome to feast upon it.
This, with the assistance of all sorts of insects, they did so
effectually that before we left the place the skulls were picked
perfectly clean, the sun had dried them, and they were ready for us to
carry off to our museum.</p><p>The skins had to be very carefully scraped, washed, salted, cleansed
with ashes and dried, which occupied fully two days.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I was lamenting our distance from the rascusara* tree, the leaves of
which had flavoured our roast peccary so nicely, when I observed among
the brushwood which the boys had brought from the thickets around us, a
climbing plant, whose leaves had a very strong smell; the stem
resembled a vine, and the fruit grew in clusters like currants. Some
were red, and some of a green colour, which I supposed to denote
various degrees of ripeness.</p></div> </div>
