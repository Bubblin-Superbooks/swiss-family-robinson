the bird or two he might kill would be of no use to us, while his shot
would not drive away the rest, even had we wished it.</p><p>Both we and the dogs were at length satisfied, and as it was getting
late, I determined to give up for the present the search for the ass,
and to return to our camp.</p></div> </div>
