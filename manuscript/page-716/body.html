sand-banks, with but a single channel leading out to the open sea; from

nothing remarkable, however, but thousands of sea-fowl of every sort

they regularly beset me, screaming and wheeling over my head, till, out
of all patience, I stood up, and hit furiously about me with the
boat-hook; when, rather to my surprise, one blow struck an albatross
with such force, that he fell stunned into the water.</p></div> </div>
