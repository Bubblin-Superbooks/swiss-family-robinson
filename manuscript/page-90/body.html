stood an open hogshead full of Dutch cheeses.</p><p>All this was very pleasant to two hungry travellers, but I was
about to beg my wife to spare the poultry until our stock should
have increased, when she, perceiving my thought, quickly relieved
my anxiety. 'This is not one of our geese,' she said, 'but a wild
bird Ernest killed.'</p><p>'Yes,' said Ernest, 'it is a penguin, I think, it let me get quite
close, so that I knocked it on the head with a stick. Here are its
head and feet which I preserved to show you; the bill is, you see,
narrow and curved downwards, and the feet are webbed. It had funny
little bits of useless wings, and its eyes looked so solemnly and
sedately at me, that I was almost ashamed to kill it. It seemed
quite destitute of any intelligence, so that I was able to kill
it with a single blow from my stick. Do you not think it must
have been a penguin?'</p></div> </div>
