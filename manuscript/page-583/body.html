calling out:</p><p>'A bear, a bear, father! He is coming after me!'</p><p>The boy clung to me in mortal fear. I felt his whole frame quivering.</p><p>'Courage, my son!' cried I, disengaging myself from his grasp. 'We must

Jack was also ready to fire, but the shock had so unnerved Ernest that
he fairly took to his heels. We fired together, one at each bear; but
though hit, the monsters were unfortunately only wounded. We found it
most difficult to take aim, as the dogs beset them on all sides.</p></div> </div>
