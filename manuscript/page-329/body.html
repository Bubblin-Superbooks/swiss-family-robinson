lost the ass, but I knew not what had occasioned his sudden flight. I
knew not whether he was aware, by instinct, of the approach of some
fierce wild beast. I said nothing of this to my family, but, making up
an unusually large fire, I bade them sleep with their weapons by their
sides, and we all lay down.</p><p>A bright morning awoke us early, and I rose and looked out, thinking
that perhaps our poor donkey might have been attracted by the light of
the fires, and have returned. Alas, not a sign of him was to be seen.
As we could not afford to lose so valuable a beast, I determined to
leave no attempt untried to regain him.</p><p>We hurriedly breakfasted, and, as I required the dogs to assist me in
the search, I left my elder sons to protect their mother, and bade Jack
get ready for a day's march. This arrangement delighted him, and we
quickly set out.</p></div> </div>
