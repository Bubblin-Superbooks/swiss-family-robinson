though my wife occasionally suffered from slight attacks of fever, and
the boys sometimes met with little accidents.</p><p>They were all fine handsome fellows: Fritz, now twenty-four, was of
moderate height, uncommonly strong, active, muscular and

agility than for muscular strength.</p><p>Franz, a lively youth of seventeen, had some of the qualities of each

drollery of Jack.</p></div> </div>
