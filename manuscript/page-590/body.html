the tongue and eyes only of the bears had been devoured: a little later
and we should have had the handsome skins pecked and torn to rags, and
all chance of steaks and bears'-paws gone.</p><p>On measuring the wings of the large bird from tip to tip, I found the
length exceeded eleven feet, and concluded it to be a condor; it was
evidently the mate of the 'Watcher', as Fritz called the first we saw.</p><p>To work we now went on the bears, and no slight affair we found it to
skin and cut them up, but by dint of perseverance we at last succeeded
in our object.</p><p>Determining to smoke the meat on the spot, we cut magnificent hams, and
took off the rest of the meat in slices after the manner of the
buccaneers in the West Indies, preserving the paws entire to be cooked
as a delicacy, and obtaining from the two bears together a prodigious
supply of lard, which my wife gladly undertook to melt and prepare for
keeping.</p></div> </div>
