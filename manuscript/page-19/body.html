<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Fritz, who was of
an age to be aware of the real danger we were in, kept watch
with us. After a long silence, 'Father,' said he, 'don't you
think we might contrive swimming-belts for mother and the boys?
With those we might all escape to land, for you and I can swim.'</p><p>'Your idea is so good,' answered I, 'that I shall arrange something
at once, in case of an accident during the night.'</p><p>We immediately searched about for what would answer the purpose,
and fortunately got hold of a number of empty flasks and tin
canisters, which we connected two and two together so as to form
floats sufficiently buoyant to support a person in the water, and
my wife and young sons each willingly put one on. I then provided
myself with matches, dry tinder, knives, cord, and other portable
articles, trusting that, should the vessel go to pieces before
daylight, we might gain the shore, not wholly destitute.</p></div> </div>
