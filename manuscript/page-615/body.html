we had last visited our colony; and some of these, two fine broods of
chickens especially, my wife wished to take back with her.</p><p>We found that the herd of antelopes which Fritz and Jack had driven
through the Gap, had taken up their abode in the neighbourhood, and
several times we saw the beautiful animals browsing amongst the trees.</p><p>While at the farm, we repaired both the animals' stalls, and our
dwelling-room, that the former might be more secure against the
attacks of wild beasts, and the latter fitted for our accommodation
when we should visit the spot.</p><p>Everything at length being satisfactorily arranged, we again retired to
rest, and early next morning completed our journey to Rockburg.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">By midday we were once more settled at home.</p></div> </div>
