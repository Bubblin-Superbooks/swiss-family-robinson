<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">waters out to sea appeared agitated by
some unseen movement, and as they heaved and boiled, their surface,
struck by the beams of the morning sun, seemed illuminated by flashes
of fire.</p><p>Over the water where this disturbance was taking place hovered
hundreds of birds, screaming loudly, which ever and anon would dart
downwards, some plunging beneath the water, some skimming the surface.
Then again they would rise and resume their harsh cries. The shining,
sparkling mass then rolled onwards, and approached in a direct line our
bay, followed by the feathered flock above. We hurried down to the
shore to further examine this strange sight.</p><p>I was convinced as we approached that it was a shoal or bank of
herrings.</p><p>No sooner did I give utterance to my conjecture, than I was assailed by
a host of questions concerning this herring-bank, what it was, and what
occasioned it.</p></div> </div>
