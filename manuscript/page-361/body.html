<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">prepared for the labourious task. A door
had first to be made, so at the base of the trunk we cut away the bark
and formed an opening just the size of the door we had brought from the
captain's cabin, and which, hinges and all, was ready to be hung.</p><p>The clearing of the rotten wood from the centre of the trunk occupied
us some time, but at length we had the satisfaction of seeing it
entirely accomplished, and, as we stood below, we could look up the
trunk, which was like a great smooth funnel, and see the sky above.</p><p>It was now ready for the staircase, and first we erected in the centre
a stout sapling to form an axis round which to build the spiral stairs;
in this we cut notches to receive the steps, and corresponding notches
in the tree itself to support the outer ends. The steps themselves we
formed carefully and neatly of planks from the wreck, and clenched them
firmly in their places with stout nails.</p></div> </div>
